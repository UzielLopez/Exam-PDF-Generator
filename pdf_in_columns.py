    Inserts an image in the current column
    This method is necessary because when inserting an image with .image() (as it is inherited from FPDF)
    the FPDF accept_page_break method would be called instead of the one that has been overriden in this class definition.
    It also helps to differentiate when you need no insert a big image vs just a helping figure for a question
    @param name (str): path to the file containing the image
    @param x (int): x coordinate within the document where the image will be inserted at
    @param y (int): y coordinate within the document where the image will be inserted at
    @param w (int): width of the image to be inserted
    @param h (int): height of the image to be inserted
    @param type (str): format of the image. If not specified, it is obtained from the image file extension
    @param link (int): if the image will be use as a hyperlink, link is the address where the user will be redirected to
